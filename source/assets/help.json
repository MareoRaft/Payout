	"help": "Payout is an application that allows you to pay out ERC20 tokens to many people at once.  We welcome you to view our <a href=''>video tutorial</a> on how to use Payout.<br /><br />Payout is built on the <a href='https://github.com/cluracan/send-tokens'>send-tokens</a> library.  It is basically a GUI for <a href='https://github.com/cluracan/send-tokens'>send-tokens</a>, with the following additional features:<ul><li>Payout can import a CSV file that contains a list of transactions.  This is useful if you keep a spreadsheet of people you need to pay, because you can pay them all in one go.</li><li>Payout has a history page where you can look up all of your previous transactions.</li><li>Payout remembers your transaction settings, so once you configure things to your needs, you won't need to worry about it again.</li></ul><br /><br />Each section in Payout has it's own 'help' message just like this one, so you can be in-the-know.  For example, if you click on the big 'Settings' section title, you will get details about the different settings available to you and how to use them.<br /><br />If you need further assistance, feel free to email me at <a href='mailto:mvlancellotti+payout@gmail.com'>mvlancellotti+payout@gmail.com</a>.  You can also raise an issue or report a bug on our GitHub <a href='https://github.com/MareoRaft/Payout/issues'>issue tracker</a>.",

	"settings": "These are the transaction settings that will be used when attempting to execute your queue'd transactions (which occurs when you click the 'Payout' button).<br /><br />Payout runs on the <a href='https://github.com/cluracan/send-tokens'>send-tokens</a> library, so the settings here are exactly the same as the settings there.  Scroll down and read the 'All Options' section which explains the settings available to you briefly, and then scroll further down and read the 'Full sendTokens() Options' section which explains the settings in further detail.<br /><br />If you need further assistance, feel free to email me at <a href='mailto:mvlancellotti+payout@gmail.com'>mvlancellotti+payout@gmail.com</a>.",

	"queue": "This is where you queue up a list of the transactions you want to execute before actually executing them.<br /><br />If you are using a spreadsheet to record the transactions you want to execute, it should have a column that holds the destination addresses in hex format and a column that holds the amounts you want to send to those addresses.<ol><li>Start by exporting the spreadsheet to CSV format.</li><li>Next, in Payout, click the 'Add transactions to queue' button.</li><li>Use the file navigator to find the CSV-formatted file.</li><li>Payout will then show you a preview of the imported information and ask 'Does this look okay?'.  If Payout imported your file correctly, the addresses will appear in the 'to-address' column and the amounts will appear in the 'amount' column.  Click 'yes' or 'no' honestly.  If it does not look okay, your transactions will fail to send.  Your CSV file should have the addresses in the first column and the amounts in the second column.</li><li>If you clicked 'yes', it will load the transactions into the queue.  If you clicked 'no', it will abort the process.</ol>You may repeat this process as many times as you'd like to load more transactions into the queue.<br /><br />Once finished, you can click the 'Payout' button to actually execute the transactions (send the money).",

	"payout": "Click the 'Payout' button to execute all the transactions in the queue.This attempts to send the amount shown in each row of the queue to the address shown in that same row.<br /><br />Any settings specified in the 'Settings' section above are also applied to the transactions.  It is important to make sure the settings are correct before sending money.  In particular, be aware that the decimals setting has the power to adjust the amount sent.  For more information, read the help for the 'Settings' section.<br /><br />Each transaction that is successfully sent will change status to 'sent' and be moved from the queue to the 'success' list below.  Each transaction that fails to send will change status to 'failed' and remain in the queue, but move to the other end of it.",

	"reset": "Click the 'Reset' button to reset the 'queue' list and the 'success' list.<br /><br />All of the transactions in those two lists will be moved to the 'History' tab of the app, regardless of their status.<br /><br />Hitting the 'Reset' button will NOT reset your settings.  Those will remain the same."
